                Click on the links from the Nav bar to see a two page web site. 
                In this example, we have essentially copied index.html and pasted it into a file 
                named blog.html, then edited the content area of the pages. Although this example 
                does reuse the style sheet, if anything in the Title, Nav, or Footer had to change, 
                someone would have to edit every single page in the web site (not a good set up). 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can still VIEW this page, but starting with the next example, 
                you'll have to RUN it (because it uses AJAX).
            </p>

        <div id="footer">
            [ your name goes here ]
