        <div style ="background-color: #DDDDDD; padding: 1ex;">

            <p>
                With this version of the code, we have employed "consumer / provider" style coding meaning 
                that the code in our JS file should be easily transferable to any other HTML page, without 
                breaking. This is because the JS file will not reference anything that was not passed to it. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Notice that the index page references a JS file named "routeFw", named after the 
                    the single function defined within (this is Sally's JS coding convention, helps you organize/find code).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The index page invokes the single function, passing in its preferences, e.g., route array 
                    (list of link/content pairs), starting link, and id of the DOM element desired to hold the content. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The function in the JS file checks the parameter object and sets some default values, if 
                    necessary. The router function (as in the previous example) simply injects the content 
                    that is associated with the active link (window.location.hash). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    As before, this line of code says that whenever the active link changes, invoke the router function, 
                    but now that function is local instead of global. 
                    <br/>
                    <pre>
    window.addEventListener('hashchange', router);
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    And this line of code injects the page with home content upon initial page load: 
                    <br/>
                    <pre>
    window.location.hash = '/home';
                    </pre>
                </li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <a href="#/home">Home</a> |
        <a href="#/page1">Page 1</a> |
        <a href="#/page2">Page 2</a> |
        <a href="#/missing">Missing Link</a>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <div id="view"></div>

        <script src="js/routeFw.js"></script>
        <script>

            "use strict";

            // set up route associative (key/value) array. 
            var myRoutes = [];

            // Add link/content entries into the route array.
            // Remember that with JS associative array syntax, the keys look like index values even though 
            // they are character strings, not integers.
            myRoutes['/'] = 'home Content';
            myRoutes['/home'] = 'home Content';
            myRoutes['/page1'] = 'page1 Content';
            myRoutes['/page2'] = 'page2 Content';

            // routeFw returns a routing object that has private and public 
            // data members and methods. 
            // This "consumer code" specifies input parameters of an array of objects that each 
            // specify path and content, id of DOM element where the FW is to place the content, 
            // and the desired starting path. 
            var myRouteFw = routeFw({
                routeArray: myRoutes,
                contentId: "view",
                startingPath: '/home'
            });

            // print the routes (check console.log)
            // This example is now a bit silly (since the HTML page already has access to the route 
            // array), but it does show you how the HTML page can get a reference to an object 
            // and then use that to invoke any public methods on the object. 
            myRouteFw.printRoutes();

        </script>
